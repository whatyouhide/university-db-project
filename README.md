# DB university project

This is the project for the [database course][course-homepage] held at
Universit√† degli Studi di L'Aquila.

The project consists of all the documentation and code needed to create a
complete database for a given problem.

The problem challenged in this project in to build a database for a company
which manages **lightning structures** (traffic lights, street lights etc.).

This repository holds both the textual documentation (written in Markdown, using
[Marked 2.app][marked]-specific features) and the SQL code
needed for the project.

All the documentation and non fixed parts of the code (comments, column
names and so on) are in Italian, my mother tongue.
